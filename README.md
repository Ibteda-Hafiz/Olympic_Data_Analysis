# Olympic_Data_Analysis
This project involves an exploratory data analysis of Summer Olympic medals awarded between 1976 and 2008. The analysis focuses on understanding various trends and patterns within the dataset. Key areas of investigation include determining the total medal counts per country, examining how the number of medals awarded has changed over the years, analyzing the distribution of medals between genders, identifying the athletes who have won the most medals, and visualizing the historical performance of the top-ranking countries in terms of medal accumulation across different Olympic years. The process begins with loading and cleaning the data to ensure its readiness for analysis, followed by generating visualizations to effectively communicate the findings.
